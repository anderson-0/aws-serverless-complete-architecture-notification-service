## Getting started
```
npm install
```

## Deploy infrastructure to AWS
```
sls deploy --verbose --stage <dev or stage or prod>
```

## Deploy function to AWS
In case you did not change configuration files such as package.json and serverless.yml you don't need to re-deploy your entire infrastructure again and waste a lot of time. You can re-deploy only the function you want and it will deploy it to AWS along with code changes in files imported by your function

```
sls deploy -f <functionName> --verbose
```

## Watch logs for scheduled lambdas in real-time
```
sls logs -f <lambda> -t
```

## Execute Lambda Function and see the logs
```
sls invoke -f <lambda> -l
```
